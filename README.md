# Mastering Chrome DevTools

A web app for teaching people about Chrome DevTools.

## How to use

```
git clone https://github.com/jkup/mastering-chrome-devtools.git
cd mastering-chrome-devtools
npm install
node server.js
```

This site is designed as teaching aid for my "Mastering Chrome DevTools" workshops but I hope it will stand fine on its own.

The workshop is divided into three sections:

Editing - Changing styles and markup and persisting changes to disk
Debugging - Using the step-through debugger
Profiling - JavaScript performance, page jank and finding / fixing memory leaks
